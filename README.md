This is a server that was created during my Objected Oriented Programming with Java Course (CS-230). The main function of this server is to communicated to other serves within the network through the client. In addition, you can also type things such as magicEightBall or magicPirateBall to send a predefined message accross to another user's server. Lastly, you may add other users IP addresses and connect them to a name, allowing you to contact that server by entering the name rather than the IP address, similar to contacts in a phone.

In order to run the server, you must follow these steps:

  1. Run the driver file
  2. Run the server file
  3. Run the client file
  
After this, you should be able to send any message to other users who followed the same steps and are on the same network.  To do this, you specify the IP address of who your message will send to, your IP address, and then the message.  
For example: 198.44.243.95 206.20.214.117 Hello
